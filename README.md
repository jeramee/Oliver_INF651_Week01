I would have used something similar to the Unlicense but the acronym would get me in trouble with the University. MIT is good for some stuff and so is LGPL. I donâ€™t like the old GPL, or Proprietary Licenses. I don't like to restrict Free Source, Creative Common stuff and I basically feel the same way about Proprietary Projects.
